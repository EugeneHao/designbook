[["phase-1-design.html", "Chapter 2 Phase 1 design 2.1 mPTI 2.2 mTPI-2", " Chapter 2 Phase 1 design 2.1 mPTI mTPI design is short for modified toxicity probability interval design (Ji et al. 2010). Suppose the probability of toxicity at dose \\(d\\) is \\(p_d\\) and \\(n_d\\) is the number of patient treated at dose \\(d\\). The number of DLTs (dose limiting toxicity), \\(x_d\\) has a binomial distribution \\(x_d\\mid p_d \\sim Bin(n_d, p_d)\\). Denote the target toxicity probability as \\(p_T\\). There are 3 possible decisions by comparing \\(p_d\\) and \\(p_T\\): \\(M_E: p_d \\in (0, p_T - \\epsilon_1)\\), escalate to the next level dose; \\(M_S: p_d \\in (p_T - \\epsilon_1, p_T + \\epsilon_2)\\), stay at the current dose; \\(M_D: p_d \\in (p_T + \\epsilon_2, 1)\\), de-escalate to the lower level dose. The mTPI design assumes the prior of \\(p_d\\) is a Beta distribution, \\(p_d \\sim Beta(\\alpha, \\beta)\\). Usually \\(\\alpha = \\beta = 1\\). The dose-finding decision rule is given by \\[ \\mathcal{D}_{mTPI} = \\arg\\max_{i\\in \\{E, S, D\\}} UPM(i, d) \\] where \\(UPM(i, d) = Pr(p_d \\in M_i \\mid x_d)/Pr(p_d\\in M_i)\\) is called the unit probability mass. In this case, \\[ UPM(i, d) = \\frac{IBeta(c_{i2}; x+1, n-x+1) - IBeta(c_{i1}; x+1, n-x+1)}{c_{i2} - c_{i1}} \\] where \\(IBeta(q; a, b) = \\frac{1}{B(a, b)}\\int_0^q \\theta^{a-1}(1-\\theta)^{b-1}d\\theta\\). knitr::include_app(&quot;https://eugenehao.shinyapps.io/mtpi/&quot;) 2.2 mTPI-2 mTPI-2 design is an extension of mTPI by cutting the escalation interval and de-escalation interval into subintervals with the same length equal to \\((\\epsilon_1 + \\epsilon_2)\\) (Guo et al. 2017). The equivalence interval (EI) is still \\((p_T - \\epsilon_1, p_T+ \\epsilon_2)\\). However, the set of intervals below EI (LI) are \\(\\{(p_T - 2\\epsilon_1 - \\epsilon_2, p_T - \\epsilon_1), \\ldots, (p_T - k\\epsilon_1 - (k-1)\\epsilon_2, 0) \\}\\) and the set of intervals above EI (HI) are \\((p_T + \\epsilon_2, p_T + \\epsilon_1 + 2\\epsilon_2), \\ldots, (p_T + l\\epsilon_1 + (l+1)\\epsilon_2, 1) \\}\\). Let \\(A_i\\) denote the set of intervals under the decision \\(i \\in \\{E, S, D\\}\\). The decision function of mTPI-2 design is given by \\[ \\mathcal{D}_{mTPI2} = \\arg\\max_{i\\in \\{E, S, D\\}} \\max_{j \\in A_i} UPM(j, d) \\] knitr::include_app(&quot;https://eugenehao.shinyapps.io/mtpi-2/&quot;) References "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
