Suppose the probability of toxicity at dose \\(d\\) is \\(p_d\\) and \\(n_d\\) is the number of patient treated at dose \\(d\\). The number of DLTs (dose limiting toxicity), \\(x_d\\) has a binomial distribution \\(x_d\\mid p_d \\sim Bin(n_d, p_d)\\). Denote the target toxicity probability as \\(p_T\\). There are 3 possible decisions by comparing \\(p_d\\) and \\(p_T\\): \\(M_E: p_d \\in (0, p_T - \\epsilon_1)\\), escalate to the next level dose; \\(M_S: p_d \\in (p_T - \\epsilon_1, p_T + \\epsilon_2)\\), stay at the current dose; \\(M_D: p_d \\in (p_T + \\epsilon_2, 1)\\), de-escalate to the lower level dose. The mTPI design assumes the prior of \\(p_d\\) is a Beta distribution, \\(p_d \\sim Beta(\\alpha, \\beta)\\). Usually \\(\\alpha = \\beta = 1\\). The dose-finding decision rule is given by \\[ \\mathcal{D}_{mTPI} = \\arg\\max_{i\\in \\{E, S, D\\}} UPM(i, d) \\] where \\(UPM(i, d) = Pr(p_d \\in M_i \\mid x_d)/Pr(p_d\\in M_i)\\) is called the unit probability mass. knitr::include_app(&quot;https://eugenehao.shinyapps.io/mtpi/&quot;, height = &quot;800px&quot;) 2.2 mTPI2 References "],["references.html", "References", " References "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
